              <p>The bespoke software, <strong>myDiscoveryResponses</strong>, is designed for the production and editing of discovery responses.
                Using the software, you can load discovery request pdf's of type:
Requests for Admissions (RFA),
Demands for Production (RFP),
Special Interrogatories (SPROG),
Form Interrogatories (FROG). These are loaded using natural language processing and OCR techniques, in order to extract the correct requests and file details from the pdf files.
Once loaded, you can move between each request and check off objections; in addition to adding custom responses. When these responses have been created, the file can then be exported as a response word document (DOCX), or saved
for future editing as a .discovery file.

              <hr>

              <h5 id="reading">Reading Files</h5>
              <p> To read a pdf file we use several natural language processing (NLP) and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques. Once
                we have created or opened a client, a file can be loaded into it. The standard file reading procedure searches through the pdf file
                and identifies possible request headings, once these are found correctly then the numbered requests will be returned. For FROGs,
                a more advanced method is used in which we scan the file and identify which FROGs have been checked off. You can also add a blank FROG
                which contains all of the available form interrogatories.
                <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                  Due to the nature of discovery request files, many have different formats and labelling systems. The reading system is continuously being improved
                  so if you encounter an issue with file reading then report it to reynoldson2002@gmail.com!
                </div>
                File details are also extracted from the discovery request files, namely: File Name, Document Name, County, 
                Plaintiff(s), Defendant(s), Propounding Party, Responding Party, Case number and date. However, this is less
                developed than the requests reading methods so you should check over all file details and fill them in accordingly; as these
                will be inserted into the exported DOCX files.
                </p>
                <p>
                A client can be saved for later editing as a custom .discovery file type. Selecting one of these files on windows will open it in
                myDiscoveryResponses as the software uses this as the default file type. Once you have created the responses for a file you can then move
                onto exporting them.
              </p>

              <h5 id="exporting">Exporting Files</h5>
              <p> 
                We can export files as word documents (.DOCX) in a number of ways. We can export a single file, export a whole client and export
                client feedback. Exporting a file inserts all of the file details, requests, objections and responses into an appropriate DOCX file
                template which can then be edited further if needed. We can also export only the submitted requests by turning on the option
                <strong>Settings -> General -> Export only submitted responses</strong>.
              </p>

              <h5 id="feedback">Using Client Feedback</h5>
              <p>
                Client feedback can be loaded into the program as long as the original word doc was exported from myDiscoveryResponses (this is because
                it requires a specific word document format). If you load client feedback into a file then it will fill all of the corresponding
                request numbers with the clients filled out feedback. This system makes it easy to send only the needed requests to the client and 
                import the responses straight back into the software.

                    <p>Shortcuts allow for faster typing of repeated phrases. A trigger is a unique text code corresponding
                      to an output value. When a trigger is typed and enter is pressed, the trigger will then be removed and the output
                      will be inserted in its place. The shortcut editor (shown on the left) allows you to add more custom shortcuts as
                      needed into the software. You can also delete these by clicking the adjacent trash cans.
